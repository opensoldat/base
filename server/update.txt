How to update the server:

If you're on *nix run the update.sh script in the patch directory to automatically patch the server.
To manually update the patch, do the following steps:

1) Add all the files (overwrite existing files) from the patch, except for update.txt and soldat.ini
2) chmod +x the soldatserver* files

Done!
